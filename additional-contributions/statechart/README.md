# Statechart
## Disclaimer

This statechart model is not showing the current project status. It was intended to develop the general functionality of the external controller. Due to the special communication model of the statechart, it is unfortunately not suitable for the further development of the external controller programmed in Ada. Nevertheless it was used as a basis for for further development steps.

In addition to the model, the tests are only available in a pre-development stage.
